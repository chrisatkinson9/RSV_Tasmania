## Repository of RSV phylogenetic trees and fishplots (Tasmania)
The following figures are supplimentary materials to the ECCMID 2024 presentation 'Evolving Beyond the Borders: Tasmania's COVID mitigation strategies provide insights into respiratory syncytial virus evolution'.

_Figure 2: Phylogenetic tree of RSV-A specimens detected in Tasmania from 2021-2023. The 2021 off-season RSV surge, occurring during a period of border lockdowns in response to the COVID pandemic (Mar 2020-Dec 2021) was primarily driven by RSV-A clades A.D.1.2 and A.D.1.3. These clades were implicated as the driver of off-season surges in other Australian states in 2020-2021, most notably in Western Australia (A.D.1.2) and in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria (A.D.1.3). Unlike other states, Tasmania saw a roughly even mix of A.D.1.2 and A.D.1.3 circulating within the community during the 2021 surge. These clades have not been detected in Tasmania since the relaxation of the borders in December 2021.  The 2022 and 2023 surges were driven by alternate clades designated as A.D, A.D.3 and A.D.3.1 by NextClade._

_Figure 3: Phylogenetic tree of RSV-B specimens detected in Tasmania from 2022-2023. RSV-B was not detected in Tasmania during its border lockdown period but became the dominant type throughout the 2022 and 2023 surges. The 2022 surge was dominated by RSV-B clade B.D.E.4; the clades B.D.4.1.1 and B.D.E.1 was dominant in 2023. All clade designations are per NextClade. The RSV-B clades were less discrete than those of RSV-A._

 _Figure 4: Alternate epi-fishplot with further breakdown of Tasmanian RSV specimen subtypes into clade designations (2021-2023). As per the above trees, the RSV-A clades A.D.1.2 and A.D.1.3 were the dominant clades circulating during the 2021 off-season surge, but a lineage replacement event after the COVID borders were relaxed lead to these clades no longer being detected in Tasmania._

_Figure 5: Expanded epi-fishplot of RSV subtypes in Tasmania covering the period of June 2017 to December 2023. No subtype data was available for timepoints prior to June 2017. The 2021 off-season surge, during which only RSV-A clades were detected in Tasmania, was notably preceded by the 2019 season where RSV-A was especially dominant, although no data is available on the clades circulating in Tasmania during this time._

_Figure 6: SkyGrid reconstruction plot of Tasmanian RSV-A and RSV-B specimens (2021-2023). RSV-A (in red) demonstrated relatively a stable effective population size throughout Tasmania's lockdown border period; population shrinkage of RSV-A occurred during the second half of 2022 and into the start of 2023. RSV-B (in blue) exhibited 2 significant increases in effective population size during 2021 and 2022, preceding the two surges in 2022 and 2023 where RSV-B was the dominant subtype._
