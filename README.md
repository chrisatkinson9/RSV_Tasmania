_Figure 3: Phylogenetic tree of RSV-A specimens detected in Tasmania from 2021-2023. The 2021 off-season RSV surge, occurring during a period of border lockdowns in response to the COVID pandemic (Mar 2020-Dec 2021) was primarily driven by RSV-A clades A.D.1.2 and A.D.1.3. These clades were implicated as the driver of off-season surges in other Australian states in 2020-2021, most notably in Western Australia (A.D.1.2) and in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria (A.D.1.3). Unlike other states, Tasmania saw a roughly even mix of A.D.1.2 and A.D.1.3 circulating within the community during the 2021 surge. These clades have not been detected in Tasmania since the relaxation of the borders in December 2021.  The 2022 and 2023 surges were driven by alternate clades designated as A.D, A.D.3 and A.D.3.1 by NextClade._
